# 🚀 Collab Challenge — Git & GitHub Workflow Practice

This repository was created as a small collaboration exercise to practice a clean and professional Git workflow.  
We focused on using branches correctly, keeping the main branch stable, resolving merge conflicts, and merging changes through pull requests.

## ✅ What We Learned
- Creating and switching branches using:
  ```bash
  git switch -c branch_name
