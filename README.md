# 🚀 Collab Challenge — Git & GitHub Workflow Practice

This repository was created as a practical collaboration challenge to strengthen our understanding of Git and GitHub.  
We focused on applying real teamwork workflows: branching, syncing, resolving conflicts, and merging through pull requests.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Practice clean and safe Git collaboration  
- Learn how to work on separate branches  
- Understand syncing with `main` correctly  
- Handle merge conflicts confidently  
- Use pull requests like real-world teams

---

## 📂 Key Concepts We Learned

### 🌿 Branching Workflow
- Creating & switching to a new branch:
  ```bash
  git switch -c branch_name / git checkout -b
  git pull / git pull origin main
  git switch 
  git merge
  git stash
  ```
---

## 🧠 Extra Git Knowledge We Picked Up
- `git status` for daily sanity  
- `git log` to see history  
- Why pulling before pushing is essential  
- Branches from different PCs  
- Rebasing vs Merging basics

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
